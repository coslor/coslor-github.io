| Variables     | `AU=42`                       | AnswerToUniverse:  .byte 42           | Defines the variable[^1], and loads it with the numeric value 42. Labels can be any length. AnswerToUniverse is a single byte, range -128 to 127 or 0-255 |

Note also that this will overwrite anything previously in the accumulator. |

[^1]: But what address does AnswerToUniverse actually represent? No, it's not 42; 42 is the value that the address gets set to when the program first runs. So what is the address? That depends on AnswerToUniverse's place in the overall program structure. For example, if the first few lines of the assembly file look like this:<br>`*=$0801`<br>`;-------------------` <br>`; BASIC header`[^2] <br>`;-------------------` <br><br>`byte $0d,$08,$d9,$07,$9e,$20,$34,$39` <br>`byte $31,$35,$32,$00,$00,$00` <br><br>`;GOTO our actual program code` <br> `jmp real_start` <br><br>`; ---constants---` <br>`VIC2_start=$d800 ;constant` <br><br>`;---variables---` <br>`var_8: .byte $00 ;a single-byte variable` <br>`var_16: .word $0000 ; a 2-byte variable` <br>`AnswerToUniverse: .byte 42` <br>So what's the value of AnswerToUniverse? Well, in a reap program the assembler will figure it for you, but just for fun, let's try it ourselves: start with the beginning address, which is $801 or 2049. Then count the bytes: the BASIC header is 14 bytes; the JMP is 3 bytes; the constants don't take up *any* space, since they're just labels; `var_8` takes 1 byte; `var_16` takes 2 bytes; and then there's AnswerToTheUniverse, which should be 2049+14+3+1+2=2069, or $815. So the *address* of AnswerToTheUniverse is **$815**, and the value in it is **42**.
