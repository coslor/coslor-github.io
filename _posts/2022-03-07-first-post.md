# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

This blog is probably going to be a bit of a mess at first, but the idea is to record and share my thoughts on various subjects as I have them. 

The first set of posts (and probably a lot of them after that will probably be on retro stuff, including:
- Commmodore 64 assembly language
- Building a C64 BASIC compiler, 
- and whatever else somes to mind.


Touched! Again!
